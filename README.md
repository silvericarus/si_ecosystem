# SI_Ecosystem
This is a WIP project about FSM and simulating nature life in an ecosystem.
> [!WARNING]
> The project has been completely restarted, as the previous approach was deemed imposible after further analysis. The app is currently under development in a very early stage, on it's prerelease version 0.3
